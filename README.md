Time Tracking: Records clock-in and clock-out times using timestamps, ensuring accurate work hour calculations.
Attendance Management: Monitors daily attendance, marking employees as present, absent, or late.
Leave Management: Supports leave requests and tracks approved or pending leaves.
Shift Management: Assigns employees to different shifts and tracks compliance.
Reports Generation: Provides summarized attendance and work hour reports for employees and administrators.
User Roles: Includes admin and employee roles with tailored access permissions.
Benefits:
Efficiency: Automates manual processes, saving time and reducing errors.
Accuracy: Ensures reliable data for payroll and compliance purposes.
Scalability: Handles data for small teams or large organizations seamlessly.
Technologies:
Programming Language: Python for logic implementation.
Database: SQLite or MySQL for storing employee records and attendance logs.
Libraries: Flask/Django for web-based systems or Tkinter for desktop GUIs.
APIs: Optional integration with biometric or RFID devices for automated input.
This system enhances operational transparency and ensures compliance with organizational policies, making it a valuable asset for HR and administrative teams.
